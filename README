This repo was forked from:
	http://github.com/nega0/pianobarfly

This repo exists mainly to prove that mp3 downloading can be done with minimal
changes. I probably won't alter this any further, since pianobar itself has a
lot of derp code in it, and should probably be rewritten clean. Which I may do.

I also want to emulate the website, not the android app, since that'll bypass
the 40 hour per month listening limit. So yeah.
